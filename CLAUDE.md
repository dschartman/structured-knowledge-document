## Using Trace for Work Tracking

This project uses [Trace](https://github.com/dschartman/trace) for persistent
work tracking across AI sessions.

**When to use trace vs TodoWrite:**

Use trace instead of TodoWrite for any non-trivial work. If it involves multiple
files, could span sessions, or needs to persist - use trace.

- **TodoWrite**: Single-session trivial tasks only
- **Trace**: Everything else (features, bugs, planning, multi-step work)
- **When in doubt**: Use trace

**Why this matters:** Trace persists across sessions and commits to git. TodoWrite
is ephemeral. For a tool designed around persistent work tracking, using TodoWrite
defeats the purpose.

**Setup (required once per project):**

```bash
trc init  # Run this first in your git repo
```

If you forget, you'll see: "Error: Project not initialized. Run 'trc init' first"

**Core workflow:**

```bash
# Create work
trc create "title" --description "context"
trc create "subtask" --description "details" --parent <id>

# Discover work
trc ready              # What's unblocked and ready to work on
trc list               # Current backlog (excludes closed)
trc show <id>          # Full details with dependencies

# Complete work
trc close <id> [...]   # Close one or more issues
```

**Essential details:**

- `--description` is required (preserves context across sessions for AI agents)
  - Use `--description ""` to explicitly skip if truly not needed
- Structure is fluid: Break down or reorganize as understanding evolves
- Use `--parent <id>` to create hierarchical breakdowns
- Cross-project: Add `--project <name>` to work across repositories
- Use `trc <command> --help` for full options
